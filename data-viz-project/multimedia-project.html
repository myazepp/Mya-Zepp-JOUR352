    <p>
      It was the year 2000 in Derry, the second-largest city in Northern Ireland.
     The Good Friday Agreement had gone into effect two years earlier, bringing
      the Troubles to an end. The city seemed to be full of hope.

    <p>
      But Abigail Aiken
      was full of dread. An academic star, she should have been focussed on the
       G.C.S.E.s, a set of exams that determine whether a sixteen-year-old in the
       U.K. will advance on a university track or end her education in high school.
       But as the exam date approached, Aiken’s mind kept wandering to something else:
       her period, which was more than a week late.
     </p>

     <p>
      Recently, her long-distance boyfriend
      had come to town for a weeklong visit, which had resulted in an unplanned
      romantic incident. Could she have gotten pregnant after her first time?
      That would be just her luck. She wanted to know, one way or the other,
      but this was Derry, a place where everyone knew everyone else’s business.
      What was she supposed to do, walk into the pharmacy and ask for a pregnancy test?
    </p>

      <p>
      A few girls from Aiken’s junior high school had gotten pregnant. Some had
      continued their schooling, but most had left early to raise their babies
      with the help of their parents. That wasn’t an option for her, she decided.
      She wasn’t one of those girls who dreamed of being a mother. She wanted to
      go to university and see the world outside of Derry.
    </p>

      <p>
      She could get an abortion,but the procedure was illegal in Northern Ireland. To obtain one, she would
      need to travel to England or Scotland—which would take money, and an excuse
      to leave school. That wasn’t happening without her parents’ help, and she
      couldn’t imagine asking them. Her father was very traditional—anti-abortion,
      anti-premarital sex. Her mother was relatively progressive, but had warned
      her, years earlier, about getting into this situation.
      “Do not get pregnant,” she’d told her daughter. “That is one thing I cannot
       help you with.”
     </p>
     <div class="quote"> “Parenthood can only be a choice if abortion is allowed.”
     <p class="attribution"> - Abigail Aiken </p>
     </div>
     <p>
      When her period was ten days late, Aiken stripped off her clothes and examined
      her body in her bedroom mirror. She’d heard about women’s skin glowing or their
      nipples changing color when they got pregnant. But, as far as she could tell,
      everything looked the same. Then, gathering her resolve, she folded her hands
      into a ball and brought it down—hard—against her abdomen. Punching her stomach
      seemed crazy, but it was all Aiken could think of. (She didn’t have access to
      the Internet.) Night after night, she performed this ritual until her stomach
      was bruised. She also stopped eating—throwing away her school lunch and making
      excuses to skip dinner—and exercised until the point of exhaustion, doing sit-ups
      and sprinting laps.
    </p>

      <iframe title="Methods for self induction" aria-label="chart" id="pie" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/NvDfS/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" align="right"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
  </script>
    </div>
    <p>
      After about five days of this, her period came back. It was more than two
      weeks late. Aiken felt overwhelmed with relief when she saw the blood. Finally,
      she could focus on her studies. She aced the G.C.S.E.s. In three subjects—English
      Literature, German, and Chemistry—she got the best results in all of Northern
      Ireland.
    </p>
      <p>
      To this day, Aiken doesn’t know if she was pregnant. But she told me that she
      can still recall that feeling of relief, twenty-one years later: “It was the
      idea that something very, very important had just happened, and that a major
       potential crisis had been averted.” Aiken was speaking from Austin, Texas,
       where she is a reproductive-health-policy researcher at the University of
       Texas. One of the subjects she studies is the very act that she attempted:
       self-managed abortion, which is when a woman ends a pregnancy without a doctor’s
       help. Historically, women have used many strategies for ending unwanted pregnancies:
      consuming noxious substances, such as the tea used in “Bridgerton,” or causing physical injury,
      of which the wire hanger is an infamous symbol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plenty of people still try to induce
      abortions at home in the way that Aiken did, but, for the most part, self-managed
      abortions have gotten a lot safer, thanks to the arrival of “abortion pills”:
      mifepristone and misoprostol. The first blocks the pregnancy hormone progesterone,
      causing the uterine lining to break down; the second causes contractions. (Women
      have been using misoprostol alone to induce miscarriages since the nineteen-eighties.)
    </p>

      <p>
      In places where abortion is legal, a doctor can prescribe
       the pills to a woman who is up to ten weeks pregnant. In places where abortion is
       illegal or highly restricted, there have been more elaborate efforts to get
       pregnant women the pills.
     </p>

     <p>
      In 2001, Rebecca Gomperts, a Dutch doctor and the founder of an organization
      called Women on Waves, chartered a ship and began sailing it to countries that
      had outlawed abortion, such as Poland and Portugal. Women could board the ship
      to obtain the pills. (The vessel was registered in the Netherlands, where abortion
      had been legalized, and Dutch laws were in effect on board.) A few years later,
      Gomperts began dispensing the pills to women in Europe through a Web site called
      Women on Web. Women could fill out a consultation form describing their medical
      history and symptoms, and, if they were in the first ten weeks of pregnancy,
      Gomperts and her team of doctors would prescribe the pills, which would arrive
      in the mail shortly afterward from a pharmacy in India. Women on Web provided
      instructions on how to take the pills, and maintained a help desk to address
      people’s questions.
    </p>
  </div>

    <iframe src='https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1FPcw2jtdmkfQtsKjtIiJlhMPLCZyh-gkPxEUVDXFyyA&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650' width='100%' height='650' webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen frameborder='0'></iframe>
    <div class="container">
      <p>
      Those two things together—the pills and the Web site—were transformational,
      Aiken recalled. “Almost immediately, it changed things in Northern Ireland.” In
      2006, she came home from medical school to find the bathroom stalls in bars and
      cafés plastered with stickers advertising Women on Web. Activists had put them
      up. “It was amazing to me to see that in Derry,” she said. She imagined how the
      Web site would have changed her life when she was sixteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight years later,
      after Aiken had become a public-health researcher, she approached Gomperts
      at a conference and asked if the two of them could collaborate. Together,
      they refined Women on Web’s consultation form, adding questions about demographic
       data and why people were seeking out the service. The organization also followed
       up with the women weeks later, to track their health outcomes and feelings after
       having taken the pills.
     </p>
     <!--
     <div class="quote2" align="left"> "When pills are used,
       inducing an abortion at home is as safe as going to a clinic" </div>
     -->
     <p>
      In 2017, Aiken and Gomperts published a study in the British Medical Journal,
       examining the experiences of a thousand women in Ireland and Northern Ireland
        who’d performed a self-managed abortion through Women on Web. The data showed
        that, in terms of safety and effectiveness, ordering abortion pills through the
        service and taking them was comparable to getting a surgical abortion in a clinic.
        Only five per cent of the women had complications that required them to complete
        the abortion under the care of a doctor; the rest were able to successfully end
        their pregnancies by using the pills.
      </p>
      <p>
         Aiken testified on the findings before the
        Irish parliament, prior to the country’s decision to legalize abortion for women
        who are within the first twelve weeks of pregnancy. She said the country’s leaders
        seemed surprised that so many Irish women were getting abortions in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
      “There is no practical way to stop the use of abortion pills in Ireland.
      That horse has bolted,” one member of parliament said, after listening to
      Aiken’s testimony. Francine Coeytaux, of Plan C, a nonprofit that shares
      information on how to access abortion pills, told me, “Her research is a
      big part of the reason that Ireland changed their laws.”
    </p>

    <p>
      When Gomperts and Aiken’s study came out, Women on Web wasn’t available in the
      U.S., where abortion was technically legal. But their research showed that there
      was still a demand for the service in America, especially in states where in-
      clinic abortions were severely restricted. In 2018, Gomperts launched Aid Access,
      a version of Women on Web for the United States. Aiken has been tracking the
      data: during the first two years that the service was offered, Americans made
      more than fifty-seven thousand requests for abortion pills. Most of the
      requests came from states with strict abortion laws, like Texas. But people
      from blue states sought the pills, too—because they preferred the privacy of
      ordering abortion medication online, or because it was cheaper than a doctor’s
      visit.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Cost was the main motivating factor,” Aiken said. On average, a
      first-trimester abortion in a clinic costs around five hundred dollars.
      Aid Access provides the pills for a hundred and five dollars, or less.

    <p>
      Abortion pills are strictly regulated in the U.S. Mifepristone is under a
      special F.D.A. program called a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy,
       which is used for dangerous drugs—meaning that the medication can only be
       dispensed in a clinic, doctor’s office, or hospital, and only by a doctor
       with a special certification, usually after some lab tests, a physical exam,
       and, potentially, an ultrasound. Your physician cannot call it into your local
      pharmacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Gomperts claims that the F.D.A. allows people to import medicines for
      their personal use, making Aid Access legal. The F.D.A. disagrees: in 2019,
      the agency sent Aid Access a cease-and-desist letter, requesting that the
      organization “cease causing the introduction of these violative drugs into
      U.S. commerce.”
    </p>


    <p>
      The agency has also periodically seized shipments of abortion
      pills. Gomperts responded by suing the F.D.A. for denying her patients’
      “constitutionally protected right to terminate their unwanted pregnancies
       prior to viability.” But the suit was ultimately dismissed, since a federal
       judge ruled that the case was not about abortion but rather about unapproved drugs,
       which would fall under the jurisdiction of the F.D.A.
     </p>
     <p>
      There has been one recent victory for the abortion-telemedicine
      movement: during the pandemic, the F.D.A. has temporarily lifted the
      requirement that the pills be dispensed in person. But reproductive-health
      advocates argue that the rule should be eliminated altogether, owing to the
      mounting evidence that the drug is extraordinarily safe. Less than one per cent
      of women who have taken the pills in the U.S. have reported serious adverse
      events, such as hemorrhage or infections requiring antibiotics.
    </p>

      <p>
      Aiken’s research has helped to change perceptions of the pills—and of
      self-managed abortions in general. The practice is often assumed to be dangerous,
      but her data continue to suggest that, when pills are used, inducing an abortion
      at home is as safe as going to a clinic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aiken said, “There are people out
      there who are very rightly questioning, If these pills are safe, why do
      I have to go through all these hoops to get them?” It’s more than just a
      matter of making them widely available online. “Why aren’t they available
      over the counter? Why can’t I keep them in my bathroom cabinet?”
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the vision that Plan C is promoting. Coeytaux, who fought for years
      to make the emergency-contraception medication Plan B available over the
      counter, sees abortion pills following a similar trajectory to the
      morning-after pill. “They could be on the continuum,” she said, where Plan
      A is contraception and Plan B is pregnancy prevention.
    </p>

      <p>
      Some people might prefer to think of the medication as “missed-period pills.” If your period
      is late, you take the pills to bring it back, without ever having to see a
      doctor—or even knowing if you were pregnant. This isn’t the norm yet, but,
      thanks to Aid Access, it’s already possible in the United States. Gomperts
      began advance-prescribing abortion pills soon after the Texas law S.B. 8
       went into effect.
     </p>
     <div class="graphic">
       <iframe title="Success Rates" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-kkHrP" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/kkHrP/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="454"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
  </script>
     <p>
      In the meantime, abortion advocates see the U.S. moving toward a two-tier system.
      In blue states, the pills will be one option among many. In red states, they’ll
      fill the gaps for people who have no other option. In the U.S., as in Ireland,
      restrictive laws have had the unintended effect of drawing attention to abortion
      pills. Coeytaux told me, “In many ways, we’ve made more progress toward self-managed
      abortion in the last two years than we could have otherwise, because of these
      egregious laws.” She said that the country is lucky to have Aiken “in the belly
      of the beast,” as Texas continues to be the center of the abortion wars. “The
      most world-renowned person working on data on safe abortion now is literally
      a Texan,” Coeytaux said.
    </p>

    <p>
      Aiken told me it’s no coincidence that she wound up in the state. “I was interested
      in being somewhere where reproductive rights are important,” she said. (She has
      testified at the Texas statehouse, although her findings have yet to make the
      impact here that they did in Ireland.) But the connection goes deeper. She’s
       married to a Texan statistician—they’ve collaborated on research projects—and
       she has grown fond of her new home.
     </p>
     <p>
        “I actually love Texas,” she said.
       “It reminds me of Northern Ireland. The beautiful landscape, the ruralness.
       People here are like the people in Northern Ireland. They’re very friendly,
       at least on the face of it.” She gets the occasional raised eyebrow when she
       tells people what she does for a living, but she’s never been harassed.
     </p>
     <p>
      She’d almost forgotten about her sixteen-year-old self, the teen-ager who had
      the pregnancy scare in Derry. Then, two years ago, she got pregnant. This time,
      she was thirty-five. She wasn’t necessarily planning on having kids. “I was still
      in the boat of ‘I’m probably never going to do this,’ ” she said. But, after
      talking it over with her husband, she made a different decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her son is now two. “He’s wonderful,” she said. She added that the prospect of motherhood feels
      different—more moving and powerful—when it’s a choice rather than something that’s
      forced upon you. That’s the flip side of abortion rights. “It’s a shame that’s not
      appreciated by more anti-abortion activists,” she said. “Parenthood can only be a
      choice if abortion is allowed.”
